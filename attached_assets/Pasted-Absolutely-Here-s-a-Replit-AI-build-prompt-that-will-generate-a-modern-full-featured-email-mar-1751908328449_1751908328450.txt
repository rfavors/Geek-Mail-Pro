**Instructions for Replit:**

> Generate the complete full-stack code for this app, including backend (Node/Express), frontend (React), PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration, email sending, payments, automation engine, analytics, multi-user roles, and all above features. Include Dockerfile and deploy instructions for Coolify. Don’t stop until all buttons, links, and functionality of the app are complete by testing and fixing all necessary functions and operations before stopping operation and asking for input from me. Use the test credentials provided for easy testing. Make sure a persistent light/dark mode toggle is implemented. Assume sensible API key names for .env (e.g., STRIPE\_KEY, SENDGRID\_KEY, DB\_URI, etc.).
